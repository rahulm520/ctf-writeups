# SOC Learning – CTF Writeups

This repository contains my documented learning from CTF challenges across CTFLearn, TryHackMe, and picoCTF.

The focus of these writeups is:
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Understanding attacker behavior
- Mapping findings to real-world security impact
- Defensive and mitigation takeaways

These challenges were completed in legal lab environments for learning and skill development.
